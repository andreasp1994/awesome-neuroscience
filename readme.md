## Resources
Interesting resources related to neuroscience.

### Blogs

- [Action Potential](http://blogs.nature.com/actionpotential) - A forum operated by neuroscience editors at the journal, Nature.

### MOOCs

- [The Fundamentals of Neuroscience | Harvard & edX](https://www.mcb80x.org/) - This course serves an introductory survery of topics in neuroscience and has no specific prerequisites, though some prior exposure to biology and/or chemistry can be helpful.
- [Introduction to Neuroscience | MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-01-introduction-to-neuroscience-fall-2007/) - Introduction to the mammalian nervous system, with emphasis on the structure and function of the human brain.
- [Computational Neuroscience | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience) - This course provides an introduction to basic computational methods for understanding what nervous systems do and for determining how they function.
- [Medical Neuroscience](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience) - This course explores the functional organization and neurophysiology of the human central nervous system, while providing a neurobiological framework for understanding human behavior.

### Newsletters
- [On The Brain](http://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/hmni-newsletter) - Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute's quarterly e-newsletter.
